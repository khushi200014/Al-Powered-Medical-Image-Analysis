MediScan is a project developing an AI system utilizing the VGG16 CNN model to analyze medical images of the eye. It aids in diagnosing eye diseases by classifying images into four categories: normal, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and cataract. The framework used to make the user interface is Streamlit.

Download the given dataset in the repository to use this AI powered project. This dataset contains some of the pre-processed images from the dataset on which the model has been trained . Run the main.py file in pyCharm IDE using "streamlit run main.py" command in the terminal.
